# Coordinates and DRO zero

Both rules produce one subject per setup. Nominal numeric recipes and tables can
remain useful while their status is unknown; they are not cleared toolpaths or
measured first-article evidence. Report numbers retain precision. Bench drawing
station/feature reference points use the dimension's declared drawing precision;
a known number without one prints its own value (six significant digits) rather
than `?`, which stays reserved for unknown values. Operation-derived rows,
computed tip targets, Z stations and contour cutter-centre tables always print
their own value, never rounded to a drawing dimension's display precision. No
STEP extraction/kernel geometry is performed by these rules; contour tables use
manifest geometry even when the M4 kernel rules run on the same bundle.

## `coordinates`

A feature-local point is transformed to model coordinates as
`model = feature_frame.origin + sum(local[j]*feature_frame.basis[j])`.
A setup coordinate is `(model - setup.origin) dot setup.basis[axis]`.
Feature frames always come from the exported manifest. The setup frame is the
exported manifest frame of that name, otherwise the plan-owned
[`frames`](plan.md#frames) entry; a plan frame may not reuse an exported name.
A plan-owned setup frame adds `plan.frames.<name>: author-declared setup frame`
and its own citations to the finding, and its stated `binding` decides whether
the transform is nominal or unbound exactly as for an exported frame.
Unknown components propagate only through nonzero coefficients. Tolerance-band
midpoints never define nominal geometry: explicit `*_nominal` values take
precedence, otherwise only scalar dimensions are usable as nominal geometry.

Worked holes (including threaded holes and counterbores), bosses, and features
used by point/hole operations require a numeric three-component `at` reference
point. An absent, `"unknown"`, two-component or partially unknown point keeps
the setup's `coordinates` status unknown; two-component sketch locations do not
imply Z = 0. A known point still needs a usable model-to-setup frame transform.
Bounds-only face, rectangular profile and pocket features do not acquire an
invented centre requirement.

On a resolved lathe, such a feature without a numeric `at` is located by the
spindle axis when the kernel measured every one of its faces as an external
surface of revolution about setup Z through x = y = 0
([turned profile](rules-lathe.md), kernel `revolved` facts): the rows
`spindle axis, kernel span start` / `end` place it at setup `[0, 0, z]` for
both ends of its kernel axial span, with its nominal diameter and X display,
and the finding cites `kernel: setups.<id>.revolved.<feature>`. A feature the
kernel reports revolved about another axis (a cross boss or hole), one it did
not measure, or any feature off a lathe still needs `at`.

Feature reference centres are distinct from hole tool-tip endpoints (those
belong to `blind_depth`). Lathe rows carry drawing stations, authored operation
endpoints, nominal diameter and radius/diameter X display. An authored local Z
can substitute for an unknown model transform only in an unbound frame; the row
retains `local_from = {op, field, axis}`. This does not bind fitted shaft length
to nominal model geometry. Dome axial samples compute
`radius=sqrt(sphere_radius^2-(z-sphere_centre_z)^2)` at authored steps and include
the exact endpoint. Each row then gets the tool-nose compensation. The selected
tool must not be flagged uncertain, and its nose radius `rn` must be known and
≥ 0. The nose centre lies `rn` out along the sphere's surface normal `n`, so each
row adds `x_tool_mm = display·(r + rn·(n_r − 1))` and `z_tool_mm = z + rn·(n_z − 1)`.
These are the DRO readings of the imaginary tool tip when the tool was touched
off on an outside diameter (X) and on a +Z end face (Z), the `zero_check`
tool-touch convention, recorded as `tool_reference`. Then
`tool_nose_compensation_mm = rn`, and the sheet prints tool columns beside the
surface columns. Compensation stays unknown, the sheet STOP stays, and
`coordinates` is unknown when any of these holds:

- the nose radius is unknown or negative;
- the tool is uncertain;
- the dome apex faces the chuck, so it is not cut from the +Z touch-off side.

`tool_nose_compensation_reason` names which one applied.

For contours, cutter radius is selected diameter/2. An explicitly rough
operation produces its rough table at cutter radius plus `rough_allowance_mm`
or, if that field is absent, `stock_to_leave_mm`. A non-rough arc or linear
contour carrying `rough_allowance_mm` produces both rough and finish tables:
rough offset = cutter radius + allowance; finish offset = cutter radius. An
unknown authored allowance leaves the rough path unresolved rather than using
zero. Operations without an authored rough allowance keep their finish-only
table. Each profile, arc and exact line-join record names its `stage` (`rough`
or `finish`), so the report and traveler distinguish the two paths even when
they share one operation number. Axial dome samples remain nominal profiles,
not an allowance/tool-nose-compensated rough path.
`arc_table` uses explicit centres, nominal radii and known finite geometry:
a boss is a full circle, a declared upper semicircle is 0–180°, and finite
rocker arcs derive endpoint angles.
Internal/top arcs subtract offset; outside/bottom arcs add it. Samples include
exact endpoints and angular grid checkpoints. `start_deg`/`end_deg` are accepted
schema fields but the current rule derives bounds from geometry rather than
using those fields to override the arc. A full circle needs continuous
interpolation; its checkpoints are not straight-chord cuts. Finite arc records
include sagitta `R*(1-cos(min(step,span)/2))` and exact offset joins. Every
feature linked through `top_edge_feature` contributes its upper land's
line-circle intersection: an outline and separately exported tip lands can
share that top arc. Mirrored −X/+X lands must agree after reflection; an
unknown or inconsistent linked join leaves the top table unknown. The lower
outline also supplies its line-line miter and bottom line-circle intersection,
with mirrored sides explicit. Degenerate joins do not become invented paths.

`linear_table` transforms explicit box bounds (or `sweep_bounds` in
`sweep_frame`). Exterior rectangular paths expand by offset; pockets require an
explicit open side and positive `step_mm`, with outside entry and finite raster
passes. Tables are numeric nominal geometry, not cutter accessibility, fixtures,
wall thickness or collision proof. Unknown/unverified cutter or frame binding
keeps status unknown. M2 lathe feasibility remains unimplemented even where
nominal stations/dome tables are displayed.

Exact message:

`Feature targets use the declared model-to-setup basis; cutter tables use explicit nominal geometry and authored allowance.`

When unresolved it appends:

` Missing geometry or unverified tool/frame binding prevents a cleared toolpath.`

## `zero_check`

A dedicated saw setup (all nonmanual ops are `saw_cut` / `cut_off`, at least one
saw) is `not_applicable`: its setting is an authored blade-centre `cut_plane`,
not a spindle XYZ zero. A mixed setup still checks its other machining zero
recipes; an unknown action cannot establish the saw-only exemption.

EL400 ABS Axis Set, not Preset. Approach side is independent of jog polarity.
For edge finding, `contact=edge + side*finder_radius`, side -1 from negative
axis and +1 from positive axis; indicated pickup uses radius 0. Paper Z uses
`contact=edge + paper`; touching `top` takes the received/advanced stock top.
Physical positive-axis jog gives `check=shown + sign*scale*jog` and
`mirror=shown - sign*scale*jog`, where `shown=scale*contact` is the displayed
Axis Set. The sign comes from authored DRO direction; lathe diameter-mode X
uses scale 2 (a `+x` touch on a 6.35 mm gauge at the axis sets 6.35, not its
3.175 radius) and radius mode scale 1; an omitted or unknown lathe
`radius_mode` leaves the X readings unknown. Other axes use scale 1.
Direction `right/away/up` (or lathe `away_from_spindle_axis/toward_exposed_end`)
is positive. Reversed direction or a non-ABS known mode is an error.
`edge_mm` explicitly locates a named pickup in the setup frame. Only Z
`face = "top"` substitutes the received stock top. Another named face (such as
an ear's inner face) uses its own authored edge; stock top is not its fallback.

For each authored Z `retouch_after`, the new set value is advanced top + paper.
A profile does not move the touched top.

X `method = "trial_cut_measure"` cuts a diameter, measures it at the machine
with the declared `gauge` and Axis Sets that reading. Like paper thickness the
reading is a bench value, so the recipe is complete when `tool` and `gauge`
resolve without a verify flag, `check_jog_mm` is numeric and the lathe
`radius_mode` is known. The rows show bench expressions: diameter mode
`measured D`, check `D +2j`, mirror `D -2j`; radius mode `measured D/2`,
`D/2 ±j`. A target diameter is never used as the measurement.

Each `[[setups.zero.tool_touches]]` entry is complete when its `tool` and X
`gauge` resolve without a verify flag and `edge_mm` and `paper_mm` are numeric:
`x_axis_set` is the same measured-diameter expression and `z_axis_set` is
`edge_mm + paper_mm`. Missing tools, unverified finder/gauge facts, missing
recipes and unknown frame binding preserve unknown. A lathe does not require a
Y zero recipe.

Templates:

- `DRO direction or mode disagrees with the setup convention; stop and correct it before the check jog.`
- `Touch, Axis Set the compensated value, then jog without retouching and compare expected versus mirrored readings.`
- The latter appends, when unknown:
  ` Measured setup/tool or trial-cut verification remains unknown.`

Evidence: per-axis contact/set/check/mirror/sign, source edge, finder radius,
paper, jog and DRO direction, retouch list, per-tool touches and transfer.

The recipe says **jog without retouching**. Physical emulator direction and
actual check readings must be exercised by the operator; local computation does
not prove the paper/emulator acceptance control.
